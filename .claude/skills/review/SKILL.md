Perform a thorough code review:

1. **Read project memory first** — check `~/.claude/projects/-home-pedropestana-codigos-python-investimentos-manual/memory/project_errors.md` for known issues to watch for
2. **Security**: secrets exposure, injection vulnerabilities, input validation
3. **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, missing indexes
4. **Type safety**: any types, missing null checks, unsafe casts
5. **Error handling**: unhandled promises, missing try/catch at boundaries
6. **Test coverage**: untested paths, missing edge cases
7. **Patterns**: check against `project_patterns.md` for consistency
8. **Style**: naming quality, code duplication, unnecessary complexity

Organize findings by severity: CRITICAL > WARNING > SUGGESTION.
Be specific and actionable — include file paths and line numbers.
